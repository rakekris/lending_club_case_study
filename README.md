## General Information

The case study is for a consumer finance company casled Lending club which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
The Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures.

THe manin objective of this case study is to find When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

For this case study we are using loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011 and a data dictionary.
